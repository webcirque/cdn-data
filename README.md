# cdn-data
We host our own copies of carefully minimized and compressed libraries. https://dist.pwcq.dev/

Please note that this repository is only a temporary solution. It'll be later switched to a CDN fetcher and compressor based on Bash or Deno. Our primary focus is to recommend useful libraries to developers, and deliver optimized files.

Because of the upcoming Flex library, some files are compressed with either BZip2 or LZip.
